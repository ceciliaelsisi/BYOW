        <h4>Beatles History</h4>
        <h5>1962-1970</h5>
        <p>Four teenagers, John Lennon, Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr, and 
        Gearge Harrison created a band that became one of the most successful 
        groups in modern history. This all started when Paul McCartney and John 
        Lennon met while Lennon was playing in a skiffle band in 1957. At the 
        time Lennon, age sixteen, had a gig with the Quarrymen band to play 
        at a church event that McCartney was attending. Later that day McCartney 
        joined in a couple of songs and was invited to become a permanent member 
        of the Quarrymen. George Harrison later joined the Quarrymen as lead 
        guitarist at the age 15. His guitar licks would help shape the group’s 
        early sound. Though still part of the Quarrymen, Lennon, McCartney, and 
        Harrison would branch off and create a core group that would soon become 
        the Beatles. The group couldn’t keep a steady drummer, so upon their 
        departure to perform gigs in Germany the band's manager brings in Ringo 
        Starr, who eventually sticks and becomes a permanent member as well.</p>

    <h4>The Name "Beatles"</h4>
    <p>The name originates from combining the words ‘beatles’ and beat’. 
    The band went through a couple of names before coming to a conclusion. 
    They have called themselves: moniker Johny, the Mon Dogs, The Silver Beetles, 
    and The Silver Beats. Finally Lennon and his friend from art school, 
    Stutcliff, came up with the name ‘the Beatles’, at the time that Stutcliff 
    was playing bass for the band.</p>
